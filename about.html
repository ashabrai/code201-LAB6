    <p class="biopat">This is Pat and his family. He resides here in Seattle with his wife and two kids. He started his business right in his kitchen bake in 2013. In 2015 he got a "GoFundMe" started after many years of postive feed back from selling his cookies at craft conventions and having a little stand at Pike Place Market every Sunday. He was a one man show with the help of his wife on occasion. His business now is growing trumendously! With the local support from businesses near. You can find his cookies at most local coffee shops here in Seattle and few gift shops in Pike Place Market.</p>
